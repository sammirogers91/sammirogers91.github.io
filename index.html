            <h2>Hello, world.</h2>
            <h4>It's nice to see you.</h4>
            <p>You are looking at my first website made with Bootstrap. This site is a cumulation of nine weeks of intense learning,
                and I would be lying if I said I wasn’t astounded by how much I’ve learned. There are 4 different categories
                of content that will be described below. All images I’ve picked are licensed for reuse and modification.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>The Path Forward</h4>
            <p>I think a little bit of backstory is needed before I tell you which direction I’m going from here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Three months ago, I hit rock bottom or somewhere close. I had failed so many classes (after being a straight-A
                student) that I dropped out of school. I failed an internship. I was burnt-out, jobless, ashamed that I had
                failed to live up to my own expectations, and at my lowest I didn’t want to live anymore.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It took me an entire year and a half to really turn my focus inward and reflect. It was then I discovered (or
                really, rediscovered) some things about myself that I had neglected. Namely, I realized I had been starving
                my inner creativity. In my pursuit of a degree that I had no passion in, in pursuit of a life that didn’t
                match up to my personality, values and inner rhythm, I had lost myself.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was so scared of following my passions, I was so focused on this image of a “rich, successful accountant” that
                I had thrown away my happiness to achieve what? This false ideal of security. And it took away almost everything
                I had worked so hard for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided to get back into art and build upon my creative talent. I’m not sure what the catalyst was other than
                I decided I was tired of being unhappy. As I began to improve my drawing and my writing, and as I began to
                learn new skills like 3D animation, I started feeling good about myself again. I thought: why stop there?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Then I enrolled in Fresno City College, with the intent of taking some graphic design classes. On a whim, as
                I was selecting my courses I happened to check out the web development courses. On a whim, I enrolled in
                server-side scripting. And, on a whim, I enrolled in this class.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now it’s my major and I can SEE myself doing this as a career.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I can’t really put into words how much my outlook on life has changed. I’m not the best. I probably won’t be
                the best at web development. But I’m going to try damn hard to learn, because I’m passionate about it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It’s never too late to begin a new path in life, and I’m so very grateful for all of the supportive people in
                my life who believed in me before I even believed in myself.</p>

                from this class has been about web development as an industry. The following topics were chosen because they

                preference. I decided to include some of the most important topics to me in regards to tools, such as the
