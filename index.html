<h1>Dogs, chocolate, and mostly Kylo Ren</h1>
<p>I'm incredibly tired. My brain is mush. Perhaps I'll write something about myself. Yes, that sounds good. Where to begin? I like chocolate. And dogs. But never a combination of the two, because chocolate is poisonous to dogs. I can't wait until the next Star Wars movie comes out. I really think The Last Jedi is going to go in a direction that most people won't expect, and will culminate in Kylo Ren's redemption, or at least the start of it.</p>
<p>I mean, have you seen the marketing for The Last Jedi? They make Kylo look like a handsome Disney prince, not a villain. They aren't marketing him as a villain at all. He looks softer, more sensitive, and even a little sad. They totally are woobifying him. And I'm not going to complain, because I think a reverse Anakin Skywalker would be an interesting take, and not to mention I'm a sucker for redemption arcs.</p>
<p>Haters are saying that they hope Kylo doesn't get redeemed, and some are flat out denying that he will. To those people I say: do you have no concept of character depth? Have you even seen the other trilogies? I understand you may be salty that he killed Han Solo, and that he is completely irredeemable because of it, and I'm not excusing his actions. But if Rian Johnson manages to pull off even the start of his redemption, and brings Ben Solo back to the light, I will probably cry like a baby.</p>
<p>Aside from geeking out over handsome Space Princes, I've been learning 3D modeling. Check out <a href="wow_a_cup.png" target="_blank">this cup</a> I made the other night using Blender. Some advantages of 3D modeling over 2D drawing are:
<ul>
  <li>It's easier to create multiple scenes since subjects are stored as singular objects that can be posed and modified at will instead of having to hand-draw them each time,
  <li>You can achieve beautiful and realistic lighting, shading, environmental effects, and physics without having to know art theory,
  <li>Jobs typically pay more.
  </ul>
